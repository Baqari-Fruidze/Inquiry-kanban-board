# Inquiry Kanban Board

## Description
  download or clone repository run npm isntal and then npm run dev
## Tech Stack
i have used zustand for state manamgment (not ract context,because it breaks nextjs server rendering)
i have used lucide-react for icons
i have used @hello-pangea/dnd for drag and it is easy to use 
i have used nextjs for server rendering
i have used tailwindcss for styling



## Notes (optional)

with litle bit more time i would implement delete,create inquiry possibilities,also real api and authentication authorization
